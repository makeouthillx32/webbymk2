Plugin "App" provides global Obsidian app commands.

Available commands:
- app:delete-file -- Delete the currently active file (moves to trash)
- app:go-back -- Navigate to the previous file in history
- app:go-forward -- Navigate to the next file in history
- app:reload -- Reload the Obsidian app
- app:open-vault -- Open a different vault
- app:open-settings -- Open the Obsidian settings dialog
- app:toggle-left-sidebar -- Show or hide the left sidebar
- app:toggle-right-sidebar -- Show or hide the right sidebar

Note: For programmatic file deletion, prefer the delete_file tool. Use app:delete-file only when the user explicitly wants the native Obsidian delete behavior (trash + UI confirmation).

## Setup Required

Settings are empty. Plugin likely needs configuration via Obsidian Settings.

## Configuration File

Settings path: `.obsidian/app.json`

To configure this plugin programmatically:
1. Read the config: read_file(".obsidian/app.json")
2. Understand the settings structure and modify values as needed
3. Write changes: write_file(".obsidian/app.json", updatedJSON)

Do NOT ask the user to open Settings UI. Modify config directly.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation:
read_file(".vault-operator/plugin-skills/app.readme.md")

IMPORTANT: After reading this file, ALWAYS take action or respond. Never end silently.
