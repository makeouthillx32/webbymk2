---

### 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

#### Issue 1: Variant L shows SKU "10" instead of full SKU

**Cause:** User accidentally typed "10" in the SKU field for variant L instead of leaving it blank.

**Fix:** 
- Leave SKU fields **empty** for auto-generation
- Only fill custom SKUs if you want to override the auto-generated format

**SQL Fix (if needed):**
```sql
UPDATE product_variants 
SET sku = 'LC2542552-P1720-L' 
WHERE sku = '10' AND title = 'L';
```

#### Issue 2: Weight not saving

**Cause:** Weight field was left empty during creation.

**Fix:** Can be updated later in Manage Product → Advanced → Edit Variant

---

## 📝 Notes for Future Product Types

This guide covers **Type 1: Multi-Size, Single-Color** products.

**Future sections to add:**
- Type 2: Single-Size, Multi-Color
- Type 3: Multi-Size, Multi-Color
- Type 4: One-Size-Fits-All
- Type 5: Products with custom options (engravings, etc.)

---

**Last Updated:** February 14, 2026
**Version:** 1.0
**Test Product:** Brown Western Aztec Printed Open Front Long Cardigan
Perfect — then this is **not** Type 4 (single variant).

This becomes:

# TYPE 4

# Multi-Color Only (No Size Matrix)

(Accessory / Hat / One Size)

This is used when:

* One size (OSFM / Adjustable)
* Multiple colorways
* No size matrix
* One weight per color (usually same weight)

---

# TYPE 4 – Multi-Color, One Size Product

Example: **Howdy Honey Western Trucker Hat**

Colors:

* Tan/Brown
* Tan/Camo

No size options.

---

## 1️⃣ Basic Product Setup

Title:

```
Howdy Honey Western Trucker Hat
```

Slug:
Click **Auto**

Price:

```
25.00
```

---

## 2️⃣ Base SKU

If vendor SKU is not provided, create normalized internal SKU:

Example:

```
WSP-HOWDY-HAT
```

We will let the system append color logic (if used),
or manually control per variant if needed.

---

## 3️⃣ Product-Level Metadata

Made In:

```
United States
```

Material:
Leave blank unless confirmed.

Do NOT duplicate this in description.

---

## 4️⃣ Description (Filtered Properly)

Remove:

* Wholesale marketplace language
* Shipping details
* “Unlock wholesale pricing”
* Packaging notes
* Screen color disclaimer

Keep clean product-focused content:

```
Show off your style in our Howdy Honey Country Western puff trucker hat.

Features:
- “Howdy Honey” in red puff ink
- Removable small pin attached to each hat
- Individually heat pressed
- 5-panel construction
- Mesh back with snapback closure
```

Keep formatting clean and readable.

---

## 5️⃣ Images + ALT Coordination (Important)

Because this is color-based:

Each image ALT must match the color variant exactly.

Example:

Image 1 ALT:

```
Howdy Honey Trucker Hat – Tan/Brown
```

Image 2 ALT:

```
Howdy Honey Trucker Hat – Tan/Camo
```

This keeps frontend mapping clean and allows color-image linking logic later.

---

## 6️⃣ Variants Section

Do NOT add sizes.

Under **Colors**, add:

* Tan/Brown
* Tan/Camo

Then click:

🔄 Generate Variants (Color x Size)

Since no sizes exist, system will generate:

2 variants total.

---

## 7️⃣ Variant Configuration

Each variant will be:

Variant 1:
Tan/Brown

Variant 2:
Tan/Camo

SKU handling:

If using base SKU:
System may append color automatically.

If manually setting:

```
WSP-HOWDY-HAT-TANBRN
WSP-HOWDY-HAT-TANCAMO
```

Weight:

```
85.05
```

Enter weight for both variants (if same).

Initial Stock:
Set individually per color.

---

## 8️⃣ Expected Result After Create

System creates:

1 Product
2 Variants (one per color)
No size matrix
Weight stored at variant level
Clean ALT ↔ color alignment

---

## ✅ Final Checklist Before Create

* [ ] Clean description (filtered)
* [ ] Color names match image ALT
* [ ] No size options added
* [ ] 2 variants generated
* [ ] Weight entered per variant
* [ ] SKUs normalized
* [ ] Categories + Collections selected

---

# 🔹 Product Upload – Type 6 (Revised)

## Multi-Size Product (Weight Stored on Size Level)

Example:
**Wranglin’ Country Western Graphic Crewneck**

---

# 🧠 Key UI Behavior (Important)

In this product type:

* Weight is entered inside **Sizes & Weights**
* You must **click the size pill** to edit its weight
* The weight auto-populates into the generated variants
* You do NOT manually type weight inside each variant card

This is critical.

---

# 🛠 Step 1 – Add Sizes (With Weight)

In **Sizes & Weights**:

Add:

```
S
M
L
XL
2XL
```

Then:

👉 Click on each size
👉 Enter weight in grams

Vendor weight:

```
453.59 g
```

Since vendor does not differentiate by size, enter:

```
454
```

for all sizes.

If actual weights vary, enter per size.

Example:

| Size | Weight (g) |
| ---- | ---------- |
| S    | 430        |
| M    | 450        |
| L    | 470        |
| XL   | 490        |
| 2XL  | 510        |

---

# ⚠ Important

If you do not click the size and enter weight:

* Generated variants will have empty weight
* Shipping calculations will be incorrect

Weight must exist at the size level BEFORE generating variants.

---

# 🎛 Step 2 – Generate Variants

After all sizes have weight assigned:

Click:

```
Generate Variants (Color x Size)
```

Since no colors exist, it will create:

```
S
M
L
XL
2XL
```

Each variant will now automatically inherit:

```
weight_grams
```

You do not need to re-enter weight inside the variant card.

---

# 📦 Step 3 – Inventory

Now open each variant and set:

```
Initial Stock
```

Leave weight alone unless overriding.

---

# 🧬 What Happens in Database

Variant stored as:

```json
{
  "size": "M",
  "material": "50% Cotton / 50% Polyester",
  "made_in": "United States"
}
```

And:

```
weight_grams: 454
```

pulled from the Size configuration.

---

# ✅ Correct Flow Order

1. Add Sizes
2. Click each size → Enter weight (grams)
3. Generate Variants
4. Add stock
5. Create product
Perfect — since this product only has **Style + Size** and no real color variation, we remove color entirely from this type.

Here is the fully updated and corrected documentation.

# 🖼️ STEP 3 — Images

This product has one image.

Upload the image.

Since there are no color variations, ALT text should describe the product clearly:

---

# 🧩 STEP 4 — Variants Setup

Expand:

```
Variants
Sizes, colors, materials, made in, and base SKU
```

---

## A) Sizes & Weights

Add:

* S

The source lists:

```

If weight does not change per size, enter:

```
283.5
```

for each size.

Weight is stored per variant.

---

## B) Styles (Dynamic Option Group)

Add Style options:

```
TEE
CREW
```

This becomes a dynamic option group stored in JSON.

---

## C) Do NOT Add Colors

Do not use the color section for this product.

There is no color variation, so leave that section unused.

---

# 🔄 STEP 5 — Generate Variants

Click:

```

# 🛠 STEP 1 — BASIC PRODUCT INFO

### Title

Cactus & Sun Embroidered Sweatshirt

### Slug

Auto-generate

### Price

Use MSRP or your retail markup

### Material (Product-Level Field)

If multiple brands:

Do NOT overcomplicate variants.

Put material like this:

```
Comfort Colors: 100% Cotton
Independent Trading Co.: 80% Cotton / 20% Polyester
```

### Made In

United States

---

# 📝 STEP 2 — DESCRIPTION

Include:

* Unisex fit
* Tone on tone embroidery
* Brand details
* Care instructions
* Keywords
* Disclaimer about screen color variation

Material can live in:

* Material field (preferred)
* Description (if multi-brand explanation needed)

---

# 📸 STEP 3 — IMAGE STRUCTURE (CRITICAL FOR UI CONNECTOR)

This is where your system matters.

You have:

* 2 Brown images (Front + Back)
* 2 Green images (Front + Back)

### 🔒 ALT RULE (MANDATORY)

ALT must equal EXACT color name only.

Do NOT use:

```
Brown - Front ❌
Brown - Back ❌
```

Use:

```
Brown
Green
Brown
Green
```

### Example Correct Setup:

| Position | ALT   | Primary   |
| -------- | ----- | --------- |
| 0        | Brown | ✅ Primary |
| 1        | Green |           |
| 2        | Brown |           |
| 3        | Green |           |

---

# 🧠 Why This Matters

Your frontend logic:

```ts
images.filter(img => img.alt === selectedColor.name)
```

So:

If user selects "Brown"
→ All images with alt === "Brown" display

If alt contains extra words
→ UI breaks

---

# 🎯 RESULT

Selecting Brown:

* Shows Brown front
* Shows Brown back

Selecting Green:

* Shows Green front
* Shows Green back

Clean.
Automatic.
Scalable.

---

# 📏 STEP 4 — SIZES & WEIGHTS

Add Sizes:

* Small
* Medium
* Large
* XL
* 2X

Add weights in grams per size.

Even if similar, always enter weight.

Example:

| Size | Weight (g) |
| ---- | ---------- |
| S    | 450        |
| M    | 460        |
| L    | 470        |
| XL   | 480        |
| 2X   | 490        |
